    <h2>Project 2</h2>

<article>
<p>The theme I am using is continuing from the I used in the weeks 1 project.</p>
<p>Again it is about the boutique I work at. The subjects are really questions we ask customers when they come into the store.</p>
<p>If they have shopped with us before? If they know about our sizing? And then we tell them about our sales. I added in things about our sales goal, but we don't talk with the customers about this.</p>
